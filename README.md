David J DeBonis' Github-hosted, semi-interactive resume &amp; CV

# Summary

Hello, and welcom to my resume repo.

My name is David J DeBonis and I am a Software Developer, Linguist, Writer, Scientist, and Educator. Among all of these identities, I am a versatile and creative professional--but you don't just have to take my word for it. My [ambitions](#ambitions) and [experiences](#experience), as well as my [current projects, directions in research, and appointments](#current-directions) all speak to these claims instead.

# Ambitions

My largest ambition in my professional career is help close the gap between humans and computers:
* **to develop, design, and engineer** communication bridges that make computation more accessible;
* **to create** interfaces with a strong affinity for human logic, intuition, impulse, and language;
* **to share and educate**:
  * to develop curriculum and resources founded in research on effective pedagogy,
  * to teach others about effective instruction, as well as encouraging them to teach others,
  * and to support, contribute-to, create, and provide open-source resources and/or platforms; **and**,
* **to advocate** for open-source software, democratized data, linguistic and digital literacy, and the implementation of tech instruction in education systems.

# Experience

What sets me apart from many software developers and data scientists is my strong foundation in writing, linguistics, and education.

## Writing

My experiences with [writing](experience/writing/) have helped me immensely with my aptitude for computational langauges, my approach to software development, and my ability to communicate about software, research, results, and findings.

## Education

What I have learned through my journey in education helps me with sharing and teaching computation. My experience in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) also helps me to approach NLP with a nuanced lens.

## Linguistics

Linguistics were what brought me to computer programming. I realized that I would never accomplish my software goals unless I learned how to utilize computers as tools. Once I started, the love for computing was enough to keep me going forward, but many of my aspirations still relate to the field of linguistics.
